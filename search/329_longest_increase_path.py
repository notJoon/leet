""" Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: 
left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary 
(i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

>>> Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
>>> Output: 4

>>> Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
>>> Output: 4

>>> Input: matrix = [[1]]
>>> Output: 1
